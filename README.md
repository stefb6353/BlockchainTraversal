# BlockchainTraversal

This project was developed on Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS

To run first clone then set the GOPATH
export GOPATH={Absoulte Path of clone}/go

Then you will be able to run the project with
go run main.go

Currently the project will just traverse the blockchain and print out each block

The goal this semester is to provide a web server to allow blockchain queries
